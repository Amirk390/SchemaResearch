### What is a Database Schema?

In database terms, a schema (pronounced “skee-muh” or “skee-mah”) is the organisation and structure of a database.

**A schema contains schema objects, which could be:**

+ tables
+ columns
+ data types
+ views
+ stored procedures
+ relationships
+ primary keys
+ foreign keys

  and more..

### Schema usefulness

In the same way that you would map the architecture of your project, Schematically mapping your database is also a very necessary and initial process when looking to map and build a database.

#### Basic schema diagram:

The diagram above shows three tables, along with their data types, relationships between the tables, as well as their primary keys and foreign keys.

### What are primary keys?

+ A primary keys is a unique identifier that is used to select or address specific data. Each table has one and only one primary key.

+  Choosing a primary key is one of the most important steps in good database design. A primary key is a table column that serves a special purpose. Each database table needs a primary key because it ensures row-level accessibility.

+ If you choose an appropriate Primary key, you can query each table row individually and modify each row without altering other rows in the same table.

+ A Primary Key value can never be NULL!
